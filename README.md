# Programming and Scripting

This repository contains exercises and practice code written in [python](https://www.python.org/). The codes in this repository are
from the standpoint of beginner programmer and includes codes for basic string manipulation, math calculations, lists manipulation, 
conditions and loops. 



## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to learn to code in python in relation to its use in [data analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis).

## Exercises for Programming and Scripting
The following list are exercises and assignments for the course Programming and Scripting. 
The codes relate to which exercise it answers, please refer to the repository or click on the code itself. 

* **Exercise 1 and 2**- [firstLast.py](https://github.com/NurseQ/Programming-and-Scripting/blob/master/firstLast.py) - This exercise
takes a number and returns the nth [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) number. This exercise also shows manipulation of strings and use of the built-in [ord](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) python function. 

* **Exercise 3**- [collatz.py](https://github.com/NurseQ/Programming-and-Scripting/blob/master/collatz.py) - This exercise takes an
integer input from a user and applies the [Collatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) conjecture or sequence to that
number. The sequence is then printed out on the screen. 

* **Exercise 4**- [euler.py](https://github.com/NurseQ/Programming-and-Scripting/blob/master/euler.py) - This exercise provides a 
solution to [problem number 5 of Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5). This exercise utilizes code to calculate for 
both the greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple. A wiki on Project Euler can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler).

* **Exercise 5**- [exercise5.py](https://github.com/NurseQ/Programming-and-Scripting/blob/master/exercise5.py) - This exercise
demostrates the opening of a file and manipulation and formatting of the contents of that file. The file used in this exercise 
is the [Iris flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) data set.

* **Exercise 6**- [factorial.py](https://github.com/NurseQ/Programming-and-Scripting/blob/master/factorial.py) - This exercise 
shows code for solving the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of a given number.
